Description: eQ-3/ELV MAX! Cube Python API |Build Status| |Coverage Status|
        =============================
        
        A python api to control the Max! Cube thermostats:
        
        - get basic info about the cube itself
        - get info about the max thermostats connected to the cube (mode, temperatures ...)
        
        Basic usage:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            from maxcube.cube import MaxCube
            from maxcube.connection import MaxCubeConnection
        
            cube = MaxCube(MaxCubeConnection('192.168.0.20', 62910))
        
            for device in cube.devices:
                print(device.name)
                print(device.actual_temperature)
        
        This api was build for the integration of the Max! thermostats into `Home Assistant <https://home-assistant.io>`__ and
        does only cover the functions needed for the integration.
